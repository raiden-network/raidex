## root of the api
everything in this api should be under
`/api/<version>/`
where `<version>` is the version number

## market
everything has to happen on a certain market
all following endpoints will be under
`markets/<market>/`
we need to aggree on how to do that, so lets skip it for now

(before get_order_book)

        }
}
```

```

### make_limit_order()

## errors
if an error occurs the code will be
`400` for a malformed request
`500` if there was a server error
`404` if the resource was not found

the error object looks like this
```
{
  'status': int,
  'message': string
}
```
maybe extend that with an application error_code
